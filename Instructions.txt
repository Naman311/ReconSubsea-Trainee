Please follow these instructions before committing any change-
(I recommend you to complete the github course first and then do this)
1. first of all do fetch origin to get your local host updates. 
2. After downloading copy your code folder in sensor directory which is already present.
3. Your folder should be named as sensor name followed by your name.
4. Inside the folder upload code with documentation written by you on word.
5. After this commit the changes with relevant name and description.
6. sync commits to master.
