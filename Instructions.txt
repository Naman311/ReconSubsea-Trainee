Please follow these instructions before committing any change-
(I recommend you to complete the github course first and then do this)
1. first of all, do fetch origin to get your local host updated. 
2. After downloading updates,copy your code folder in sensor directory which is already present in this repo.
3. Your folder should be named as sensor name followed by your name.
4. Inside the folder upload the code with documentation written by you in ms word.
5. After this, commit the changes with relevant name and description.
6. sync the commits to master.
